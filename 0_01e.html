<main class="content">
<p>Smoke rose from the furnace; red iron lit up the tongs and shovel. Sweat slid down to the corners of the blacksmith’s eyes—yet he didn’t blink.</p>
<p>“Tss…”</p>
<p>Hot iron boiled yellow clay; a hundred foldings drove out the slag. True iron may still break; only sincere devotion lets steel shape itself.</p>
<p>“More charcoal!”</p>
<p>“Bellows!”</p>
<p>Under the shade of a willow thick as a man’s embrace, the blacksmith barked orders in a steady rhythm. On his left, a short, heavy-set scholar shoveled black charcoal into the fire—his clothes filthy, his face plain and honest. On his right, a tall, thin scholar pumped the leather bellows. He stood downwind, ash smoking his face so dark that for a moment you could hardly make out his features.</p>
<p>The blacksmith himself wore a loose gray robe, patched with layers of furnace dust. He had the lean bones of a crane and the posture of a pine, with an air that was free and unrestrained. His hair fell freely down his back; his shoulders were bare, his chest open to the air. His arms were dark and thick, shining with summer sweat. When he straightened, he stood nearly eight <em>chi</em> tall<sup>1</sup>, half a head taller than the thin scholar beside him.</p>
<p><sup>1</sup><em>Chi</em> (尺): an ancient Chinese unit of length. In the Wei–Jin period, one <em>chi</em> was roughly 23–24 cm (about 9 inches).</p>
<p>A moment later, he clamped a piece of glowing iron from the furnace, set it on the anvil, and swung up two hammers as big as fists, lifting them high over his head.</p>
<p><strong>CLANG! CLANG!</strong></p>
<p>Not Tang or Wu. Not Zhou or Confucius. Step beyond the rules of fame and duty. Follow nature.</p>
<p><strong>CLANG! CLANG!</strong></p>
<p>Let the heart be as clear as the sky; let the body be as free as white cloud. Let the four seas be one home, and all things one body.</p>
<p>He scraped away slag with the tongs, then struck again.</p>
<p><strong>CLANG! CLANG!</strong></p>
<p>With ardor we think of those who came before, and dream of building an age of splendor. If the past went wrong, the future can still be pursued.</p>
<p><strong>CLANG! CLANG!</strong></p>
<p>If the whole world is drunk, how could he pretend to be asleep? If the whole world kneels, how could he not stand tall?</p>
<p>The red-hot plate bent. He folded it over itself.</p>
<p><strong>CLANG! CLANG!</strong></p>
<p>The sky darkened; the iron burned the eyes. Let sparks leap—let them light one small corner of heaven and earth.</p>
<p><strong>CLANG!</strong> Just as the next hammer blow was about to fall, a young voice called from far away, <span class="c-jiying">“Father! Father!”</span> The blacksmith looked up. Through the fresh green bamboo, a small figure ran hard—then, in a blink, she was right in front of him.</p>
<p>She was a little girl in a pink dress and flowered skirt. Her twin hair-buns had come loose from running; messy strands fell over her shoulders. Her phoenix eyes tilted upward, her nose was narrow, her lips thin.</p>
<p><span class="c-jiying">“Father—lots of visitors are coming up the mountain!”</span> She was panting, but her eyes were bright. A dimple showed at the left corner of her mouth—yet no one had ever called her “cute.”</p>
<p>“The other five are already here? So early.” The blacksmith grabbed a dirty cloth and wiped the sweat from his forehead.</p>
<p>The girl gave a quick laugh. <span class="c-jiying">“More than five. More like fifty!”</span></p>
<p>The tall, thin scholar asked, “How did Yun Terrace Mountain come to have so many visitors? Who are they?”</p>
<p><span class="c-jiying">“The boy servant said something like ‘some commandant… some Hui.’ I didn’t catch it.”</span></p>
<p>“Ah…” The short, heavy scholar sighed. “When flocks of common birds descend, I go water my vegetables.”</p>
<p>The blacksmith nodded. “A-Du, Zi-Qi, you’ve worked enough. Go rest.” Then he slid the iron back into the furnace. “Yan-Shao—take over the bellows for me.”</p>
<p>The girl frowned, anger rising fast. <span class="c-jiying">“How many times do I have to tell you? A courtesy name is fake and pretentious! You gave me this name—why don’t you use yours?”</span></p>
<p>“Fine. Ji Ying (嵇縈).” The blacksmith nodded. “You’re not a fish meant for a small pond. I’m teaching you forging and music. When you grow up, you can make your own living—like me—without bowing to the world’s breath.”</p>
<p><span class="c-jiying">“I’m only eleven. Let you raise me a few more years.”</span></p>
<p>The blacksmith gave a soft sigh. “This sword I’m making is for you. I’ll teach you some sword skills for protection.”</p>
<p>Ji Ying’s eyes lit up. Overjoyed, she snatched the leather bellows handle from the tall scholar’s hands and pumped hard. A clean wind rushed into the brick furnace—flames and ash burst from the top, and a wave of heat slapped her face.</p>
<p>“Don’t rush. Slow and steady. Do you want a black face like your uncle?”</p>
<p>She stepped aside from the heat and slowed down. <span class="c-jiying">“Father, make me the sharpest and most piercing weapon in the world—so I can cut down every bandit and every crooked official!”</span></p>
<p>“This steel has been forged ten times. The sword will be sharp and strong.” A confident smile flickered at the corner of the blacksmith’s mouth—then his face returned to its usual stern calm. “Remember: the strongest weapon in this world isn’t made by fire and hammer. It’s the deep thought you pour into your words and deeds…”</p>
<p><span class="c-jiying">“Words and deeds?”</span> Ji Ying cut in. <span class="c-jiying">“Insulting someone’s ancestors? Punching people? I’m already pretty skilled. But I know I still need to train for the higher arts—cursing without dirty words, and beating people without lifting my own hand.”</span></p>
<p>“…You’ll understand when you’re older. Bad people can’t all be killed. If you fight bandits and villains with words and deeds, maybe you can change them little by little.”</p>
<p><span class="c-jiying">“Isn’t a clean stab to the throat faster?”</span></p>
<p>The blacksmith shook his head and didn’t answer. He clamped out the glowing iron again and raised the heavy hammer—</p>
<p><strong>CLANG!</strong></p>
<p>“Don’t stand there daydreaming. Add charcoal.”</p>
<p><span class="c-jiying">“Oh.”</span></p>
<p>Father and daughter focused on their work. Down the mountain path, people began to stream upward in all colors and shapes. In no time, canopies and carriages filled the slope; fat oxen snorted and stamped. More than fifty guests, servants, and guards gathered before the blacksmith, forming a wide half-circle, watching the forging like a show. Ji Ying hated the stares. She felt like an animal in a cage, pointed at and judged. She thought, “If you treat me like livestock, why shouldn’t I pay you back?” In the smoke, she forced her eyes open and studied their faces: rat-eyed weasel-faced men and monkey-mouthed ape-jawed ones, all in silk and jade, rich and smug.</p>
<p>Suddenly a loud voice shouted from the crowd: “The Commandant of the Capital Region has arrived!” Ji Ying’s shoulders jolted.</p>
<p>The commandant stepped out at once. Ji Ying saw a man of medium height, pale skin with a hint of red, neat brows, and a handsome face. He wore deep indigo brocade and a dark green silk sash. Even walking through bamboo at midnight, a roadside bandit might not notice him. He stopped a few steps from the blacksmith, bent into a long formal bow, showing off a tall gold-threaded cap, and offered a wooden name tablet with both hands.</p>
<p><strong>CLANG! CLANG!</strong></p>
<p>The blacksmith’s hammer didn’t slow. The commandant stayed bowed.</p>
<p><strong>CLANG! CLANG!</strong></p>
<p>Ji Ying thought his posture looked uncomfortable. She reached out and took the tablet. She recognized every character. Delighted, she read it aloud in a clear voice: <span class="c-jiying">“Commandant of the Capital Region; Marquis of Dongwu Pavilion; Zhong Hui (鍾會) of Yingchuan, courtesy name Shiji—bows twice and asks after your health.”</span></p>
<p><strong>CLANG! CLANG!</strong> The hammer kept ringing, steady and strong. The blacksmith’s health was normal—his body powerful—no need for concern.</p>
<p><span class="c-zhonghui">“Young lady,”</span> Zhong Hui said with a polite smile, <span class="c-zhonghui">“may I ask—could this be the Gentleman of the Palace, Ji Shuye (嵇叔夜)?”</span></p>
<p>Ji Ying almost laughed out loud. She thought, “A high official, and he’s this clueless? In Shanyang County, who doesn’t know the Yun Terrace blacksmith is Ji Kang (嵇康)?” She planted her hands on her hips and flashed a bright smile. <span class="c-jiying">“I’m Ji Kang. That one’s my apprentice. What do you want?”</span></p>
<p>Zhong Hui froze for a moment. His face went blank. He patted the little girl’s shoulder—quietly pushing her aside—and then turned to the guests. <span class="c-zhonghui">“Everyone—this is Ji Shuye! A great man of our age, a treasure of Wei!”</span></p>
<p>The guests gasped and broke into praise:</p>
<p>“That’s him! At sixteen he wrote ‘Nine Odes on Wandering the Mountains.’ The late emperor admired him and appointed him magistrate of Xunyang!”</p>
<p>“‘Rhapsody on the Zither,’ ‘Treatise on Nourishing Life,’ ‘On Sound Without Sorrow or Joy’—all his work!”</p>
<p>“At twenty, he was made a palace gentleman!”</p>
<p>“He married the Martial Emperor’s granddaughter—Lady of Changle Pavilion!”</p>
<p>Hearing her father praised, Ji Ying couldn’t help feeling proud—yet she was also startled by how well these people knew his past.</p>
<p>Most people, when flattered, would clasp their hands and reply with polite lines—“I don’t deserve it,” “You honor me,” “I was lucky.” But Ji Kang seemed not to notice the fifty people in front of him at all. He simply kept striking the red iron—bend, fold, return to the furnace—then glanced at Ji Ying. She didn’t dare slack off and kept pumping the bellows.</p>
<p>Suddenly the guests fell quiet. Zhong Hui had raised his right arm. His face was full of confident pride as he bowed again. <span class="c-zhonghui">“I have disturbed you today, Shuye, for one public matter and one private matter. The public matter first: The Duke of Jin governs through filial piety. He thirsts for worthy men and has long admired your rare talent. He has ordered me to invite you to serve—overseeing the writing office and official records. I beg you to look upon the state and the people, and pity the common folk.”</span></p>
<p>Ji Kang kept forging. Even under willow shade, sweat covered his face. He squatted where he was, pulled a wooden bucket closer, dipped a gourd ladle, and drank.</p>
<p>No one spoke. The entire crowd stared at Ji Kang squatting and drinking. After two ladles, he lifted the whole bucket, tipped his head back, and poured cool water straight into his mouth. It splashed down his chest, soaked the ash-stained robe, and ran into the yellow earth.</p>
<p>Ji Ying thought to herself: <span class="c-jiying">“These idiots want Father to serve Sima Zhao like an ox. What a joke—stumbling straight from one trouble into the next! Father already chose to live in hiding. Mother hates the Sima clan most of all. If Father works for Sima Zhao, Mother might storm off and leave home. My little brother would follow her. I’d probably stay with Father…”</span></p>
<p>Her thoughts drifted—then someone in the crowd asked, “Is Ji Shuye deaf?”</p>
<p>“Never heard that.”</p>
<p>“Why is he pretending not to hear?”</p>
<p>“So full of himself he looks down on everyone?”</p>
<p>Complaints spread. Insults rose like weeds. Ji Ying’s heart tightened. But her father pushed himself up calmly, clamped the iron, set it on the anvil, and raised the hammer high—</p>
<p><strong>CLANG! CLANG!</strong></p>
<p>The ringing was harsh. The dust was filthy. Not worth hearing. Not worth a glance.</p>
<p><strong>CLANG! CLANG!</strong></p>
<p>Suddenly a rat-faced guest stormed forward and shouted into Ji Kang’s ear: “Hey! You’re only a minor sixth-rank official! How dare you insult the Duke of Jin’s invitation, and treat the Commandant with such arrogance?”</p>
<p>Afraid he might hurt her father, Ji Ying snapped back, <span class="c-jiying">“This is the Ji family’s home. What beast dares act wild here?”</span></p>
<p>“Isn’t the Central Plains all Wei territory? Every home must obey the court!” the monkey-faced guest yelled.</p>
<p>At the words “Wei territory,” Ji Ying’s anger exploded. She stepped forward and shouted, <span class="c-jiying">“‘Wei territory,’ is it?”</span> She pointed at Zhong Hui’s chest. <span class="c-jiying">“Then go take Wei territory back from Sima Zhao!”</span></p>
<p>The moment she said it, the whole crowd went silent. Zhong Hui’s left eye twitched; his gaze never left Ji Kang.</p>
<p>“Little vixen!” “No discipline!” “Shameless!” The guests and servants cursed like a dam breaking—deafening and ugly. Ji Ying couldn’t even hear the words clearly anymore, so she roared back, <span class="c-jiying">“Pigs and dogs! Foxes and hounds! Trash—every last one of you—get out! Stop screaming while we forge!”</span> She was about to keep going when a hand clamped her arm. She turned—her father’s large hand held her fast. He shook his head. His eyes were cold and stern. Ji Ying shrank her shoulders and fell silent.</p>
<p><strong>CLANG! CLANG!</strong> No matter how they cursed, Ji Kang kept forging. Zhong Hui raised his arm again. Though the guests were red-faced, their shouting slowly died.</p>
<p><span class="c-zhonghui">“If that is so,”</span> Zhong Hui said, <span class="c-zhonghui">“then I will ask about the private matter.”</span> A servant handed him a long yellow brocade bundle. He untied the thick red cord and revealed several bound wooden slips. <span class="c-zhonghui">“This is my humble work, ‘Treatise on the Four Fundamentals,’ discussing the differences and ties of talent and nature. I beg you to review it and offer guidance.”</span> He tied the cord again, his gold cap tilting, and offered the bundle with both hands.</p>
<p>Ji Kang had raised the next hammer—then stopped. Ji Ying and the guests held their breath.</p>
<p>It was clearly late summer, yet a wild, cold wind suddenly swept through the valley. Flames in the brick furnace whipped and twisted; the heat drained away.</p>
<p>Seeing her father still unmoving, Ji Ying seemed to understand. She grabbed the bellows handle, aimed it at the furnace vent, and pumped. Smoke rose fast. Ji Kang met her eyes and nodded. His arm lifted—and the heavy hammer fell again.</p>
<p><strong>CLANG! CLANG!</strong></p>
<p>Zhong Hui stayed bowed. Behind him, the guests were already struggling to breathe.</p>
<p><strong>CLANG! CLANG!</strong> Sparks burst. The sound was crisp, sharp, and it struck straight into the heart.</p>
<p>At last Zhong Hui stood upright. His face was blank. Ji Ying saw his hands—still holding the brocade bundle—trembling slightly. He turned and walked back into the crowd, stiffly, without stopping, farther and farther away. The guests muttered and left with the servants and guards. Only then did Ji Kang finally speak—his voice deep and heavy, heavier than iron on stone.</p>
<p>“What did you hear that brought you here? And what did you see that will go with you?”</p>
<p>Zhong Hui stopped on the spot. His body barely moved as he turned his head to look back, eyes filled with a hard, endless resentment. The guests also turned—staring at the blacksmith, like a strange crag and a proud pine.</p>
<p><span class="c-zhonghui">“I came because I heard what I heard. I leave because I saw what I saw.”</span></p>
<p>In one sudden motion, Zhong Hui flung his arm and threw the brocade bundle high into the blue sky. The heavy wooden slips came crashing straight toward Ji Ying’s head. Luckily she had run through bamboo since childhood—light on her feet, quick in her body. She bent and slipped aside on instinct. Behind her, <em>啪!</em> The bundle slammed into the corner of the yellow brick furnace and fell into the charcoal pile.</p>
<p><strong>CLANG! CLANG!</strong></p>
<p>With the steady hammering, Zhong Hui and his party stumbled away in messy steps, leaving only tangled footprints in the dust—and a few “gifts” from the ox carts.</p>
<p><span class="c-jiying">“You should get down and sniff the ground before you go!”</span> Ji Ying yelled down the mountain.</p>
<p>“Add charcoal,” Ji Kang said, pointing at the pile. Then he added, “You’re fierce like me. Your anger rises too fast. You need to learn how to guide it. Forgive those common people.”</p>
<p>Ji Ying had almost been hit, then argued with a whole crowd. She felt wronged—and now she was being scolded. She scooped up the brocade bundle with the iron shovel and was about to toss it into the furnace. Ji Kang stopped her, took the bundle, untied the red cord, and pulled out the wooden slips.</p>
<p>“The bundle did nothing wrong. Keep it.”</p>
<p>Ji Ying’s anger flipped into joy. She accepted it, eyeing the black embroidery along the edge—bright and showy. “What should I use this to carry?” she thought.</p>
<p>Ji Kang had already unrolled the slips and read, line after line, at a glance. Ji Ying didn’t dare interrupt him. She only lifted her head and looked toward the north—</p>
<p>White birds skimmed across the hundred-zhang red cliffs of Yun Terrace Mountain. A thin waterfall poured from the top—before it could reach the green pool below, the summer wind tore it apart into drifting mist.</p>
<p>Since birth, Ji Ying had lived on Yun Terrace Mountain, north of Shanyang County in Henei Commandery. She had been sickly as a child, so Ji Kang often took her hiking and spoke to her about the world. He lived by smelting iron; his forged swords were famous near and far. He had a circle of close friends. Two of them had even moved nearby as neighbors—the short, heavy scholar Lü An (呂安) and the tall, thin scholar Xiang Xiu (向秀). Lü An loved farming. Morning and night he watered his fields, and whenever he saw Ji Ying, he gave her fruit.</p>
<p>Besides Ji Kang and those three households of recluses, Yun Terrace Mountain sometimes sheltered vicious bandits too. Their followers quarreled and fought with Ji Ying often. But most of the criminals respected Ji Kang for despising the government, so no one had crossed the line into murder.</p>
<p>In no time, Ji Kang finished reading the slips and stared into the bamboo, thinking.</p>
<p>A light wind passed through the grove with a creaking sound. The furnace fire weakened; the iron, now shaped like a sword, still held warmth.</p>
<p><span class="c-jiying">“Father—was it well written?”</span></p>
<p>Ji Kang silently rolled up the slips and made as if to toss them into the furnace. Then he stopped. His rough fingers felt the surface—smooth and glossy with lacquer.</p>
<p>“Ji Ying—did we run out of toilet bamboo? I told you to split new strips. You didn’t do it, did you?”</p>
<p>“Heh heh heh… hee hee hee.” Father and daughter looked at each other and laughed.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a loud long whistle rang behind Ji Ying: <strong>“Ji Shuye has real guts—he didn’t give Zhong Hui a single word!”</strong> It startled her so hard she shivered. She recognized the voice. Turning, she saw her father’s friends coming up the path. The one shouting was Uncle Ruan Ji (阮籍). He walked in laughing, belly round, a huge jar of wine on his shoulder.</p>
<p>Behind Ruan Ji came his nephew Ruan Xian (阮咸), carrying a bright square-shaped lute in one hand. “I admit defeat!” Ruan Xian shouted too, though his voice lacked half his uncle’s strength.</p>
<p>“Ji Shuye truly deserves to lead us.” The speaker was another man holding a wine jar—short, ugly, and named Liu Ling (劉伶). He didn’t talk much, but once drunk he talked without stopping.</p>
<p>After Liu Ling came Wang Rong (王戎), small in body but sharp-eyed, only in his twenties. “Such calm strength—how could an ordinary man do it?” he said, hands clasped.</p>
<p>“I fear Zhong Hui won’t let this go,” said the gray-bearded Shan Tao (山濤), gentle and steady as always, standing behind Wang Rong.</p>
<p>“Common affairs of common people. Turn your mind and forget them,” replied Xiang Xiu, now with his furnace ash washed off, revealing a pale scholar’s face. He had once written a critique of Ji Kang’s ‘Treatise on Nourishing Life,’ and Ji Kang had answered it in defense. Since then, Xiang Xiu had deeply respected Ji Kang, moved to Yun Terrace Mountain, and often came to ask for guidance.</p>
<p>With Ji Kang, these seven often gathered in the bamboo grove. Each had talent enough to shape the world. Their talk was beyond the ordinary; their writings were outstanding. They led the spirit of the age and bent its fashions. People called them the “Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove.”</p>
<p>Poor Lü An was also a gifted man, yet beside the Seven Sages he could hardly join the conversation. He only planted wild vegetables; he never attended their gatherings. Still, Lü An had moved here because he had once debated Ji Kang on a treatise called ‘On Bright Courage,’ and came to admire Ji Kang’s mind.</p>
<p>“Ji Ying—go home and bring the zither,” someone said.</p>
<p><span class="c-jiying">“Okay!”</span> Ji Ying answered at once, hugged the wooden slips and the brocade bundle, and ran home.</p>
<p>When she burst through the door, her mother Lady Cao (曹氏)—naturally beautiful, no makeup—was on a couch teaching classics to Ji Ying’s six-year-old brother. Lady Cao saw the ash on Ji Ying’s clothes and the mud on her skirt and frowned. “Yan-Shao went forging with your father again? How many times have I told you—blacksmithing and music barely keep a household fed. Why won’t you learn the sages’ teachings like your brother, become a proper noble lady, and someday help your husband and raise children?”</p>
<p><span class="c-jiying">“Common chores for common people—nothing worth mentioning. I’m not reading dead books.”</span> Ji Ying snapped back, pretending not to see her mother’s sharp glare.</p>
<p>Her brother set down his bamboo slips and blinked. His eyes were almost twice as big as Ji Ying’s. “Sister, it was noisy outside. What happened?”</p>
<p><span class="c-jiying">“Commandant Zhong Hui brought a crowd. He wanted Father to serve Sima Zhao as a clerk in his office.”</span></p>
<p>“Hmph!” Lady Cao’s face hardened. “Sima Zhao and his brother claim to be Wei ministers, but they are Wei thieves. Heaven won’t bless them! Grand Tutor Zhong was a great minister of Wei, favored by the state—yet he raised Zhong Hui, a traitorous disgrace, willing to be Sima Zhao’s dog. May he die badly! How did your father answer?”</p>
<p><span class="c-jiying">“Father didn’t bother with them. He drove them off—and we got a nice bundle of toilet bamboo, hee hee hee.”</span> As she spoke, Ji Ying opened a wooden cabinet and took out her father’s zither bag, wrapped in a worn red cloth.</p>
<p>Lady Cao laughed for a moment—then her brows knit with worry. “Zhong Hui is Sima Zhao’s favorite. He now controls the whole province. If we offend him, we may not be able to live safely in Henei.”</p>
<p>Ji Ying’s brother looked up. “Mother—will we end up like Kong Rong’s two sons? ‘When the nest is overturned, how can any eggs remain unbroken?’”</p>
<p>Lady Cao shook her head. “Kong Rong was brilliant as a child, but foolish in old age and plotted against the court. We are humble and cultivate virtue. We live in hiding. We won’t suffer that kind of fate.”</p>
<p>Ji Ying burst out laughing. <span class="c-jiying">“Ha! Mother, you really believe the court’s story? Kong Rong was framed!”</span></p>
<p>Her brother jumped in. “I remember Father said the one who killed Kong Rong’s whole family was Mother’s grandfather—Chancellor Cao!”</p>
<p>Lady Cao slammed the couch. “Rebellion! My ancestors built their cause through hardship and pacified the realm. Only then did the people have peaceful days. Heaven sees clearly—good is rewarded!”</p>
<p>Ji Ying shook her head. <span class="c-jiying">“Heaven has eyes—and it pays back every grudge. Back then Chancellor Cao held power over the whole court and replaced the Han emperor with a Wei emperor. Today Sima Zhao stands at the peak of power. Our Wei ‘Sweet-Dew Son of Heaven’ should be careful.”</span></p>
<p>“Wild girl—now you’re cursing our family to be punished by Heaven?” Lady Cao waved her off. “I can’t teach you. I’ll teach Yan-Zu well and not shame our ancestors.”</p>
<p>Ji Ying’s temper flared again. <span class="c-jiying">“Ji Shao—do you want to hear the Seven Sages’ talks in the bamboo grove?”</span></p>
<p>“Of course!” Ji Shao’s eyes lit up. He bowed goodbye to his mother, ran forward with quick steps, and grabbed his sister’s hand.</p>
<p>Ji Ying smirked in victory. With the red zither bag in her right arm and her brother’s hand in her left, she turned and left the house.</p>
<p>“Come back early! Don’t let Yan-Zu learn your father’s drinking friends! And don’t let him take any ‘medicine’!” Lady Cao shouted from the window.</p>
<p><span class="c-jiying">“The Cao clan, the Sima clan—go, go, go,”</span> Ji Ying muttered as she walked.</p>
