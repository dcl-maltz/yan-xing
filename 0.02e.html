<main class="content">
<p>Ji Ying and her younger brother, Ji Shao, returned to the willow-shaded smithy. The brick furnace still held a faint ember, but the Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove were nowhere to be seen. The siblings followed the stream toward a valley in Yuntai Mountain.</p>

<p>The ravine narrowed as they walked. On both sides rose red cliffs, layered with countless horizontal lines, as if the rock had been stacked one thin sheet after another. After days of rain, slender threads of water spilled down the cliff faces into the gorge. The stream below ran emerald and fast, roaring through the canyon and throwing its echoes back and forth.</p>

<p>They waded upstream until they reached a red-stone bridge with no handrails, spanning the two banks. Beneath it, the pool flowed on and fell in three curtains of water—small, then middle, then large—like a set of veils being drawn downward.</p>

<p>Ji Ying led her brother carefully onto the bridge. Halfway across, Ji Shao asked, “Sister, does <em>pure talk</em> really make people wiser? Mother says it’s impractical and wastes life.”</p>

<p>Hands on her hips, Ji Ying declared: <span class="c-jiying">“The Seven Sages are the philosophers of our age. What do the vulgar call ‘practical’—and why should it deserve them? To sit and speak of the Way is work fit for sages. Only when your reasons are clear and your will is firm—when you set your path and never turn aside—can you become someone pure and whole, like Father, and stand as an example to the world!”</span></p>

<p>Ji Shao nodded earnestly. “Confucius said, ‘When I walk with two others, there is always something I can learn.’ How much more with the Seven Sages. Still… it’s my first time hearing such talk. I’m afraid I won’t understand.”</p>

<p>Ji Ying thought to herself, <em>Their debates about the hidden principles are so deep. Of ten sentences I hear, nine drift past me like fog.</em> But she took her brother’s small hand and said, <span class="c-jiying">“Don’t worry. When the time comes, I’ll explain it to you.”</span></p>

<p>Ji Shao looked at her with pure admiration.</p>

<p>Down from the bridge, around a low slope, the roar of the gorge weakened. Before them spread a vast bamboo forest. Above the bamboo stood a single sheer wall of red rock, soaring toward the sky. White egrets glided in front of it like slow arrows of light.</p>

<p>Carrying their zithers, the siblings entered the forest. A cool breeze brushed their faces. Suddenly, tall bamboo joints bent and creaked—<em>ga, ga</em>—as if they might snap and collapse. The sound pressed the two children into walking faster. While catching her breath, Ji Ying smelled a faint, clean fragrance. She looked up and saw, astonishingly, countless small flowers blooming among the green bamboo leaves—tiny, rice-awn blossoms.</p>

<p>Ji Ying had never seen bamboo flowers before. Curious, she reached up and plucked a handful. White petals, yellow stamens—delicate and strangely refined. Ji Shao copied her, saying he wanted to bring the flowers to their mother.</p>

<p><span class="c-jiying">“Why bother? Dressing up the surface is shallow.”</span> Ji Ying flicked the bamboo flowers from her hand, and pale yellow dust drifted down.</p>

<p>“Sister,” Ji Shao said, “Mother is of imperial kin, yet she lives in poverty with Father in the mountains. She won’t spend money on powder or ornaments. But these flowers cost nothing.”</p>

<p>Ji Ying had no answer. She and Ji Shao picked a few more and followed a narrow path deeper into the bamboo.</p>

<p>After a short while, they caught sight of a blue-green pool and heard voices. Suddenly Ji Ying cried “Ah!” and spun around, her cheeks warming. By the water lay two wine jars. Beside them, piles of robes. The Seven Sages had stripped bare—tall and short, thin and stout, skin pale as jade or dark as bronze, hair black or graying—openly unashamed, soaking in the pool together.</p>

<p>Ji Shao stared without blinking. “So <em>pure talk</em> means you take off everything and sit in clear water to talk?”</p>

<p><span class="c-jiying">“...They’ve taken medicine. It makes the whole body sweat. When the heat becomes unbearable, they soak in water to cool down.”</span></p>

<p>“What medicine?”</p>

<p><span class="c-jiying">“Cold-Food Powder. It’s made from ground stones—red, yellow, purple, white, and black. Father and the others take it to ‘nourish life’: it clears the mind, lightens the body, strengthens the breath, and prolongs the years.”</span></p>

<p>“Mother says medicine harms the body. Many people have died from taking it.”</p>

<p><span class="c-jiying">“That’s because they take too much.”</span> Ji Ying pinched the tip of her little finger and wagged it in front of her brother’s face.</p>

<p>They chatted idly for a while. When the medicine’s force faded, the sages rose one by one, dried themselves, and put back on their loose robes. They sat around the pool drinking and talking. Ji Ying and her brother stepped forward to pay respects. Seeing Ji Shao, the sages praised him as obedient and lovable. Ji Ying gently pulled him aside and sat quietly with her zither.</p>

<p>Ruan Ji lifted his bowl, drained it, and said, “Ji Shuye—what is Zhong Hui saying in this treatise, <em>On Talent and Nature: Four Positions</em>?”</p>

<p>Ji Kang—now in a plain white robe, his face flushed with health—replied, “Zhong Hui’s four positions are: talent and nature are the same; talent and nature are different; talent and nature can be separated; and talent and nature tend to merge. All four are ideas about how to choose officials and judge people—used from the Han down to our present court.”</p>

<p>The others asked Ji Kang to explain. He paused, then spoke slowly: “In early Han times, officials were recommended through local nomination. Those who sought office needed both ability and virtue. If the one who promoted them had a keen eye—like the famed judge of horses who could recognize a thousand-mile steed—then talent would rise everywhere, and government would be clear.”</p>

<p>“But if the one in power is dull and stubborn,” Ruan Ji said, “then even a thousand-mile steed can run wild in the open fields and still go unrecognized. So the sickness piles up, and the state collapses.”</p>

<p>Ji Kang nodded. “When one is good by nature and good in talent—and evil by nature and poor in talent—so that the two cannot be told apart, that is called ‘talent and nature are the same.’ In Shu, they inherited the Han system. Earlier, the Chancellor Zhuge Kongming was just and capable, and he raised men like Jiang Wan, Fei Yi, Dong Yun, and Jiang Wei—famous for virtue and outstanding in ability. But in recent years, the Chief Secretary Chen Zhi and the eunuch Huang Hao have held power. They promote their own. Their followers are ordinary men—no virtue, no skill, dim in mind. The old system returns: those recommended as ‘learned’ cannot read; those praised as ‘filial’ do not even live with their fathers. This is the flaw of ‘talent and nature are the same.’”</p>

<p>Shan Tao, gray-haired as a mountain ridge, said, “This spring, Chen Zhi fell ill and died. Zhuge Liang’s son, Zhuge Zhan, now handles affairs. There may be a turn for the better.”</p>

<p>Just then, Ji Ying’s right sleeve moved without wind. Ji Shao was tugging at it. In a small voice he asked, “Sister, where is Shu?”</p>

<p><span class="c-jiying">“In the Shu region—Chengdu—thousands of miles to the southwest, far beyond the horizon. Their armies have raided our borders year after year. Many soldiers on both sides have died.”</span></p>

<p>“Why do they attack us?”</p>

<p><span class="c-jiying">“Because the realm is split in three. It’s either you die, or I do.”</span></p>

<p>Ji Ying saw her brother’s puzzled face. At that moment, several white egrets flew overhead. She pointed at them and said, <span class="c-jiying">“Birds fight over food. Beasts fight over mates. People fight over money, status, and land. Everything under Heaven is always struggling.”</span></p>

<p>She found her words quite reasonable and smiled, a little proud dimple appearing at the corner of her mouth.</p>

<p>Ji Shao asked again, “Father lives in hiding on Yuntai Mountain. How does he know about countries a thousand miles away?”</p>

<p><span class="c-jiying">“Sometimes Father goes to the Imperial Academy in Luoyang to copy the stone-classic texts. Uncle Ruan and Uncle Shan are officials—news reaches them quickly.”</span></p>

<p>Ji Shao nodded. “So Father relies on wide learning and good friends. The classics say: a gentleman chooses where he lives, and chooses whom he travels with, to keep away from crookedness and stay close to what is right.”</p>

<p>Hearing her brother recite, Ji Ying rolled her eyes upward.</p>

<p>Xiang Xiu, thin and pale, emptied a bowl of wine and swayed his head. “Brother Shuye, the Han classics flooded the world. Scholars grew rigid. Every sentence had to quote a sage; every matter had to invoke Heaven’s signs. So fools filled the court. They took praise as beauty and flattery as goodness. They could not tell high from low, right from wrong. The truly wise were left alone, unseen. The Han scholars’ failure was ‘good nature but weak talent’—not ‘talent and nature are the same.’”</p>

<p>Ji Ying glanced at her brother and said, <span class="c-jiying">“Hear that? The classics harm people.”</span></p>

<p>Ji Kang continued: “Seeing the defects of Han practice and the chaos at the end of Han, the Martial Emperor proclaimed ‘use people for talent alone’ and changed the standard. A talented man could be promoted even if his character was poor; a virtuous man would not be used if he lacked ability. This is ‘talent and nature are different’—the logic behind Wei selection.”</p>

<p>“Ha!” Liu Ling, his nose red with drink, slapped a stone and laughed. “When Xu Zijiang met the Martial Emperor, he called him ‘a hero in times of chaos, a villain in times of peace.’ That, too, is a ‘talent and nature are different’ man!”</p>

<p>Hearing Liu Ling call her mother’s grandfather, Cao Cao, a villain, Ji Shao pouted. Ji Ying did not grow angry—she often repeated the adults’ stories about Cao Cao’s cunning and had argued with her mother over them many times.</p>

<p>Ruan Xian, holding a bronze pipa, sighed. “Guan Ning once cut his mat in half to break with Hua Xin; later Hua Xin rose to Grand Commandant. Jia Xu plotted chaos in Guanzhong and later stood among the Three Excellencies. These are the disasters of ‘talent and nature are different.’”</p>

<p>Ji Kang nodded. “Under ‘talent alone,’ those with better character refuse to keep company with those of worse character. The worse grow in power; the worthy sit alone and go unseen.”</p>

<p>Ruan Ji swallowed a mouthful of wine and cursed loudly: “So the court fills with hypocrites and thieves of reputation, with schemes and backstabbing. First Cao Shuang grew arrogant and extravagant and lost the people’s trust; then the Sima father and sons seized power. Wei ministers abandoned their lord—and still walked away as if nothing had happened!”</p>

<p>Ruan Xian plucked a sharp note—<em>keng</em>—and said, “Wei replaced Han; Jin replaces Wei. A house leaves the world the same way it entered it.”</p>

<p>The group sighed. Ji Kang lowered his hands into the blue pool. “Talent alone made Wei strong quickly. It swept the Central Plains and held two thirds of the realm. But without cultivation of virtue—greed, rot, luxury, falsehood—no foundation can last. The same idea can bear a boat and overturn it. That is simply the Way of things.”</p>

<p>“Sister,” Ji Shao pointed at the tufted rod in Wang Rong’s hand. “What is that for?”</p>

<p><span class="c-jiying">“A fly-whisk. He wants to speak.”</span></p>

<p>Wang Rong flicked the whisk, and everyone looked to him. “If ‘same’ and ‘different’ both fail by being one-sided,” he asked, “are ‘separate’ and ‘merge’ more precise? I ask Master Ji to enlighten us.”</p>

<p>Ji Kang answered: “‘Same’ and ‘different’ grow from the idea of what does not change. ‘Separate’ and ‘merge’ grow from the idea of change. ‘Separate’ says talent and nature can be pulled apart. Even if a man’s nature is bad and his talent is bad, as long as he learns one usable skill, he can still be employed. So, for a time, local schools stopped teaching the classics and taught farming, crafts, and trade skills instead—so people could at least secure a living.”</p>

<p>“And so,” Xiang Xiu sighed, “the world fills with people whose speech is coarse and whose minds are empty. They do not understand what earlier generations achieved. They think themselves right and feel no shame.”</p>

<p>Ji Kang replied, “People’s abilities differ. Division of labor is natural. If someone is slow and cannot judge better from worse, then even if he studies the sages’ words, he will not truly grasp them. He will memorize stiffly and imagine he has ‘gained the Way’—like certain Han scholars. Wei did not repeat the old error. Even if it made new ones, perhaps we can still praise the attempt.”</p>

<p>“Brother Shuye is a great vessel,” Ruan Ji said with a faint smile. He raised his bowl; Liu Ling, Ruan Xian, and Xiang Xiu clinked bowls with him—<em>ding, ding, ding</em>—and drank. They urged Ji Kang to join, but Ji Kang declined.</p>

<p>“Sister, why doesn’t Father drink with the uncles?”</p>

<p><span class="c-jiying">“Father says: once you wake from a dream, to pretend to sleep again is only lying to yourself. He wants to stay awake.”</span></p>

<p>“Father is amazing. Every time I wake from a dream, I just turn over and fall asleep again.”</p>

<p><span class="c-jiying">“...Of course.”</span></p>

<p>“When I grow up, I want to be great like Father.”</p>

<p><span class="c-jiying">“Me too.”</span></p>

<p>“How can you be like Father? You can’t become a court gentleman. You can only be chosen into the palace to become a lady.”</p>

<p>Ji Ying patted her chest. <span class="c-jiying">“I will never sell myself for rank!”</span></p>

<p>Shan Tao turned back with a gentle smile. Afraid she had spoken too loudly, Ji Ying lowered her head at once.</p>

<p>Ji Kang continued: “Last is ‘merge.’ This was Zhong Hui’s own creation: it claims talent and nature naturally grow closer. Seeing that too many in court have thin virtue, the court now promotes ‘ruling by filial piety’—to teach those with talent but poor character, and to select those who have both filial behavior and ability.”</p>

<p>“Brother Shuye,” someone asked, “do you think Zhong Hui is right?”</p>

<p>Ji Kang said, “Just as ‘separate’ comes out of ‘different,’ so ‘merge’ is the same old Han pattern—local nomination, then scholars who wrap themselves in classics. It clings to appearances and goes even further. Then everyone competes to display a reputation for filial piety in order to gain office. Meanwhile powerful ministers borrow the name of ‘abdication’ to carry out real usurpation. They no longer encourage loyalty, righteousness, or humaneness. They speak only of filial piety—and even less sincerely than Han scholars did.”</p>

<p>Xiang Xiu snorted. “Zhong Hui praises ‘merge’ loudly to flatter the court. He boasts of talent and virtue—yet by doing so he reveals his own disloyalty, lack of kindness, and lack of justice. Childish. Absurd.”</p>

<p>Ji Kang said, “Same, different, separate, merge—these vary by person and circumstance. If one simply cultivates both talent and character, why force the world into four positions?”</p>

<p>Everyone nodded. Shan Tao asked again, “Even if ‘merge’ has nothing new, without teaching and moral guidance, how can we correct a world where virtue is thin?”</p>

<p>Ji Kang did not answer. He looked to Ruan Ji. Ruan Ji smiled. “Has Mountain Juyuan truly been blinded by official life? If you keep the mind quiet and the awareness clean—wandering beside clear streams, guarding the subtle and true teachings—wanting nothing and chasing nothing, then you are already following the natural Way. Alas, in our age there are no heroes to shape the times—only boys of muddy days rising to fame, stumbling back onto an old road.”</p>

<p>Ji Ying’s sleeve moved again—Ji Shao tugged her. “Sister, I don’t understand.”</p>

<p>Ji Ying herself had long since drifted away in thought. She answered casually: <span class="c-jiying">“He means: there are many bad people and many fools in court. Good and clever people—like us—hide in the mountains.”</span></p>

<p>Ji Shao frowned. “Why don’t good and clever people drive the bad and foolish into the deep mountains? If good people are clever, can’t they defeat the bad?”</p>

<p>Ji Ying shrugged.</p>

<p>After the sages finished judging <em>On Talent and Nature: Four Positions</em>, Ji Kang beckoned to the two children. Ji Ying understood: such a gathering was never complete without drink and music. She rose and brought her zither forward.</p>

<p>Ji Kang removed the red cloth wrapping. The instrument was elegant: a pale fir soundboard, a dark lacquered nanmu back, silk-wrapped strings, and jade inlays marking the positions. A refined fragrance seemed to rise from it.</p>

<p>Ji Kang sat cross-legged, set the zither on his knees, and said, “Recently I learned a children’s song. Its melody is deep and far. I have rewritten the lyrics.”</p>

<p>Then his face fell into quiet sorrow. “Before I play, there is bad news. The bamboo flowers have opened on Yuntai Mountain. This whole forest will soon wither. For ten years it will not grow again.”</p>

<p>“Ah…” The group sighed with regret. Ji Ying feared they would turn soft and theatrical—lamenting bamboo, praising shoots, dabbing sleeves at tears. That would be disgusting. Thankfully, they held to the old claim that music has no sorrow of its own; the sages felt no grief, only drank on. Ji Ying looked around. She had grown up in these bamboo groves. To think the forest had reached the end of its life… But then she remembered her father’s words: everything blooms and withers; life and death are natural. Why be sad? <em>Then they cannot be called the “Bamboo Grove” Seven Sages anymore,</em> she thought.</p>

<p>Ji Kang placed both hands on the strings—plucking, brushing, hooking, striking—then, after the prelude, he sang out in a full, powerful voice:</p>

<p>“Life is brief; Heaven and Earth endure. A hundred years—who can claim it long? I think of rising beyond, to save what will not decay, and look up to the ancient friends of wisdom.”</p>
<p>“At dawn I leave Mount Tai and Hua; at dusk I lodge in the sacred land. I befriend Song Qiao and wander hand in hand—playing zither, chanting verse, letting care fall away, hair loose among sheer cliffs.”</p>
<p>“Wealth and splendor rush like a wild current; fame and praise chase the handsome and clever. Loyalty, filial duty, benevolence, righteousness—empty tongues display them; I have a will that will not bend.”</p>
<p>“Vast and light, my heart holds hills and valleys. I think of Laozi and Zhuangzi and carry on what came before. Riding the wind, I go high and far—no fragrance, no stench—finding the Way and seeing the universe clear.”</p>

<p>Ji Kang’s voice was deep and resonant, filling the four directions. The Seven Sages listened as if intoxicated—calm, open, delighted in antiquity, forgetting worldly affairs. When he finished, Ruan Xian lifted his square pipa; Wang Rong struck a stone with his fly-whisk; Ruan Ji and Liu Ling tapped pottery bowls; Xiang Xiu and Shan Tao clapped hands and thighs. They followed Ji Kang in a bold second singing—true people, true knowing—nourishing spirit and harmonizing feeling.</p>

<p>When the singing ended, human sounds fell still. Yet bamboo and water did not: the wind through leaves and the stream’s falls continued without rest. The gentle, solemn, hidden truth of Heaven—silent—coiled around the heart.</p>

<p>Suddenly Ji Kang raised his bowl. “Zhong Hui has four positions on talent and nature. I have understood four <em>levels</em> of talent and nature. In memory of our many years gathering in these bamboo groves, I share them with you.”</p>

<p>Hearing her father announce a new theory of his own, Ji Ying listened with all her attention.</p>

<p>“To understand Heaven, Earth, and the universe—this is wisdom. From childhood to old age, wisdom grows in different orders and at different speeds. People end in different places and yet arrive by the same road. There is no need to divide ‘same, different, separate, merge.’ From youth to maturity, there are roughly four stages. The first three roughly correspond to the pursuit of Beauty, Goodness, and Truth.”</p>

<p>“The first stage: one only seeks ‘beauty’—rank and splendor, fine food and clothing, grand houses and pleasures. One chases advantage and avoids harm; survival comes first, often by any means. The second stage: one abandons beauty and seeks ‘goodness.’ One speaks of loyalty, trust, filial duty, and compassion; one praises oneself for punishing evil. Some go so far as to trade their lives for it—or sacrifice others. People of the second stage hate the first for its wickedness.”</p>

<p>Xiang Xiu sighed. “The world is a torrent. Most people are of the first stage—vulgar beyond endurance. I avoid them as if they were plague.”</p>

<p>Wang Rong flicked his fly-whisk again. “So when the court rules by filial piety, it hopes first-stage people will rise to the second.”</p>

<p>Ji Kang nodded. “But the effect is weak. ‘Goodness’ benefits the many. ‘Filial piety’ benefits one’s own elders. Goodness does not end at filial piety. To rule by filial piety is less than to rule by goodness.”</p>

<p>He looked over the group and continued: “The third stage is to abandon beauty and goodness and seek ‘truth’: to pursue what is real and search for the source. When the breath is quiet and the spirit is empty, the heart does not cling to pride, and one can step beyond rigid teachings and follow nature. Grasping the root, the mind reaches the principle; feelings are not tied to desire, and one can judge honor and shame while understanding people’s hearts. Speech hides nothing; action conceals nothing. Clear in spirit and upright in mind, one weighs right and wrong fairly, casting one’s chest toward the eight wild horizons and valuing frankness across the long days. People of the third stage dislike the second for its self-righteousness and lack of true understanding.”</p>

<p>Hearing this, Ji Ying grew secretly pleased. <em>So I’m only eleven, and I’ve already advanced to the third stage!</em></p>

<p>Ruan Ji suddenly burst into laughter. “What Shuye says is exactly so. Second-stage people love Confucian rules, or cling to spirits and rites. In the past I followed Confucian teaching and prided myself on guarding ‘goodness’—I was exactly a second-stage man. Now, as I grow older, I have understood: the true person has no fixed home—Heaven and Earth are his guesthouse; the true person has no master—Heaven and Earth are his belonging; the true person has no business—Heaven and Earth are his old friends. No strict line between right and wrong; no fixed difference between good and evil. I dare not call myself a ‘true person,’ yet at least I have risen to the third stage—worthy of celebration! In all the realm, how few are those who seek truth and the Great Way. Ruan Ji is fortunate to have you all as friends and kindred spirits!”</p>

<p>He threw back a whole bowl of wine.</p>

<p>“Well said!” Liu Ling lifted a wine jar and drank straight from it. The rest followed.</p>

<p>Wang Rong asked again, “Master Ji says wisdom has four stages. If the fourth seeks neither beauty, nor goodness, nor truth—what does it seek?”</p>

<p>The six sages and the two children listened with full focus. Ji Kang’s face was calm. After a long pause, he said slowly: “I know only the rough surface. I cannot yet grasp the subtle essence. I only know it is something like: ‘standing apart, walking alone—doing as one chooses.’”</p>

<p>“People divide talent and nature,” he went on, “but one who stands apart can see: the beauty of securing warmth and food; the goodness of protecting dignity and self-respect; the truth of reaching beyond the body and not perishing. Yet he does not settle inside these three realms.”</p>

<p>As they were still thinking, Ji Ying murmured to herself: <span class="c-jiying">“Doing as I choose—what’s so hard about that? So I’ve already reached the highest stage?”</span> The sages burst into laughter. Ji Ying blushed, wishing she could smash her head into a bamboo stalk.</p>

<p>Ji Kang explained, “Everyone wishes to do as they choose. But if one with shallow knowledge indulges his will too early—without knowing what truly matters—he may gain only the outer shape, and the bonds of order may fall apart. The harm could be worse than anything in ancient or modern times. These stages are built by years of experience. Forcing them is useless. I beg my child and my friends: be cautious. Guard yourselves.”</p>

<p>Ruan Ji nodded. “If even Shuye has not fully understood the fourth stage, we need not strain for it. Let us be content with the third!” He turned to Ji Ying and Ji Shao and asked with a smile, “Little sister, little brother—what stage have you reached?”</p>

<p>Ji Shao answered solemnly, “My sister’s skill at scolding is extremely high. Even bad people can’t out-scold her.” The group laughed again. Ji Ying wanted to leap into the pool and drown on the spot.</p>

<p>So the sages played, sang, drank, and rejoiced without restraint. Ji Shao begged Wang Rong for the fly-whisk and waved it about. The sages laughed and said pure talk would not die out.</p>

<p>When wine ran hot in their ears, Shan Tao asked Ji Kang to speak aside. They happened to pass near the children. Shan Tao’s expression was heavy. “Shuye, what happened earlier is no small matter. Zhong Hui prides himself on talent, envies the wise, and hates the worthy. I fear he will not let this go. Since you have read his treatise thoroughly, it may be best to offer a brief comment—fair words, a few guiding hints—enough to flatter him into satisfaction. Perhaps ask Ruan Sizong to persuade him to drop it.”</p>

<p>Ji Kang’s face grew stern. “Brother Juyuan: times change. Some bend and enter the world to preserve the body. Some stand alone outside the world to preserve the will. I would rather keep my integrity than change my course for Zhong Hui.”</p>

<p>“Living in this age,” Shan Tao sighed, “one cannot avoid bending at times.”</p>

<p>Ji Kang shook his head. “In Qin, long ago, Lord Shang’s reforms made young and old alike worship war. Everything was for military success—scrambling for merit and rank, forgetting virtue. It is said that a Confucian scholar once lit a candle at sunset and sat alone by the wall of Xianyang, night after night. A guard asked, ‘Why do you sit under the wall?’ The scholar answered, ‘Lord Shang’s new laws turn people into beasts. I cannot agree.’ The guard said, ‘You sit here with a candle—what use is it? You cannot shake the affairs of state by yourself.’ The scholar said, ‘If I light one candle, at least people can see: someone has not become a beast.’”</p>

<p>Shan Tao sighed again. “But human hearts are not what they were. Lord Shang’s tolerance is no longer here. In our day, those who light candles risk their households. If you wish to keep distance from Zhong Hui and avoid the storm for a time, why not take this chance to travel, to see the world and learn from the great? It would broaden your wisdom. I can watch over your family. Zhong Hui would not dare act rashly.”</p>

<p>Ji Kang fell silent.</p>

<p>Ji Ying thought, <em>If Father goes traveling, won’t I be left with Mother and my brother, sitting in a bamboo forest that is dying—or dying in Uncle Shan’s house instead? He is an official; he smiles at vulgar guests every day. That would be unbearable.</em> She tugged Ji Kang’s sleeve and pleaded: <span class="c-jiying">“Father, if you travel the realm, take me with you.”</span></p>

<p>“Ji Ying,” Ji Kang said softly, stroking her head, “you must walk your own road.”</p>

<p>Shan Tao added, “Little sister, little brother—you may travel with my five sons.”</p>

<p><span class="c-jiying">“I want to go with Father!”</span></p>

<p>“This road is the road Father has chosen. A person is born alone. Father is not afraid of loneliness—so you must not be afraid, either.”</p>

<p>Ji Ying had followed Ji Kang all her life. Now, seeing her father about to leave her behind, she panicked and tears spilled down. <span class="c-jiying">“No! I’m going with Father. Father will forge me a precious sword, and I will protect him!”</span></p>

<p>Ji Kang said, “Do you remember what Father told you? The sharpest weapon in the world is not a divine sword or treasured blade—it is a deep thought poured into one’s words and deeds. You and Yanzu will each use a different way, but you will both walk this same road with Father.”</p>

<p>So Ji Kang’s plan to leave home was settled. He bid farewell to the six sages. They were reluctant, yet they also blessed him: may his wisdom deepen, and may they meet again someday to exchange ideas and ask about the true meaning of the “fourth stage.”</p>

<p>But the Seven Sages did not know: this would be their last gathering.</p>
